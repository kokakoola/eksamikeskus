<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>Modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on both desktop and smartphones have been tested. Not tested on IE.</p>

<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
<p>One Page Scroll let you transform your website into a one page scroll website that allows users to scroll one page at a time. It is perfect for creating a website in which you want to present something to the viewers. For example, <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone-5s/">Apple&#8217;s iPhone 5S website</a> uses the same technique.</p>

<p>To add this to your website, simply include the latest jQuery library together with <code>jquery.onepage-scroll.js</code>, <code>onepage-scroll.css</code> into your document&#8217;s <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and call the function as follows:</p>

<p>````html</p>
<body>
  ...
  <div class="main">
    <section>...</section>
    <section>...</section>
    ...
  </div>
  ...
</body>
<p>````
Container &#8220;Main&#8221; must be one level below the <code>body</code> tag in order to make it work full page. Now call the function to activate as follows:</p>

<p><code>javascript
$(".main").onepage_scroll({
   sectionContainer: "section", // sectionContainer accepts any kind of selector in case you don't want to use section
   easing: "ease", // Easing options accepts the CSS3 easing animation such "ease", "linear", "ease-in", "ease-out", "ease-in-out", or even cubic bezier value such as "cubic-bezier(0.175, 0.885, 0.420, 1.310)"
   animationTime: 1000, // AnimationTime let you define how long each section takes to animate
   pagination: true, // You can either show or hide the pagination. Toggle true for show, false for hide.
   updateURL: false // Toggle this true if you want the URL to be updated automatically when the user scroll to each page.
});
</code>
And that&#8217;s it. Now, your website should work the same way Apple&#8217;s iPhone 5S website does. You should be able to swipe up/down as well (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/eikes">Eike Send</a> for his swipe events!) when viewing your website on mobile phones.</p>

<h2>Public Methods</h2>
<p>You can also trigger page move programmatically as well:</p>

<h3>$.fn.moveUp()</h3>
<p>This method allows you to move the page up by one. This action is equivalent to scrolling up/swiping down.</p>

<p><code>javascript
  $(".main").moveUp();
</code></p>

<h3>$.fn.moveDown()</h3>
<p>This method allows you to move the page down by one. This action is equivalent to scrolling down/swiping up.</p>

<p><code>javascript
  $(".main").moveDown();
</code></p>
