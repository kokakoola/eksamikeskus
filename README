## File structure
- Build folder contains browser servable files, generated by hammerformac. No need to touch it.
- _Bootstrap-2.3.2 is for viewing Bootstrap documentation locally as the project is built on that
- Root is the working directory. 
- less is the css-files directory. style.less is the only file you need to add styles. Mark your part of css in file with your name. 
- the big parts are html-s in the root. Naming should be: user-function.html e.g. examinant-test.html. They are the skeletons where are included other html parts, separated by functionality. 
- _includes folder contains main includes (head, header, footer) and subdirectorys for webparts. Follow teh same structure please through project.

## LESS
You don't have to write css in less unless you want to: less can read regular css as well. It improves the structure and speeds up the process, so it is suggested. As browser can read css only you need less compiler to convert less to css (target directory is css in root). [Winless](http://winless.org/) for example.

## Javascript
Javascript into footer part (_includes/footer.html). Generate a separate javascript file for your own js, lets compile them together later (to not to conflict each other). Custom javascript files are named with prefix advokatuur-*.

Did I forget something? Ask me.
Happy coworking!
